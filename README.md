This current project is basically about learning the fundamentals of web development. There are two paths to be chosen for this project. One that focuses on the backend development of web pages, and another one focused on the frontend part of the development. I will choose the backend path once im invited to make the decision. 

I expect to acquire some basic, yet sufficient, skills that could catapult me to start working for a team of developers, working on personal development projects, opening a path of further valuable learning of useful skills, or any of these scenarios. I may be able to demonstrate that im capable of understanding with enought depth the concepts and abilities required to be able to develop functional programs and web applications.
